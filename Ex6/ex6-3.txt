# 1. Go through each line and list each variable that is being assigned a string. For example x, binary, and y are examples of variables being assigned strings, but hilarious is not because False doesn't have "" around it.

# 2. This is your list of strings, so now you just need to see which ones have strings being put inside them.

# 3. Go through your list of strings, and find each one that is on the right side of a + or a %.

# 4. The ones on the right of a % + are the "strings going into strings" and that's your count.




If we list each variable that is being assigned a string we have the following variables:

x
binary
do_not
y
joke_evaluation
w
e

If we go throught the list of strings and find each one that is on the right side of a + or a %, the answer will be 5, not 4.
