I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?


In this case it is not necessary. If we had an average, we would sometimes need to make the average(passengers variable) come out as a float. One way of doing this is to be sure one of the inputs is a float.

If it's just 4, the result will be an integer and not a floating point.
